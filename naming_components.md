1. MULTI-WORD COMPONENT NAMES to prevent conflict with all current & future HTML elements, which are all one word (eg, 'chat' vs 'chat-container')
2. BASE COMPONENTS (aka presentational, dumb, or pure components) should be prefixed with 'Base', 'App', or 'V'
3. SINGLE INSTANCE COMPONENTS prefixed with 'The'
4. TIGHTLY COUPLE COMPONENT NAMES when components are only used w/in parent component
